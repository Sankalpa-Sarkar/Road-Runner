# Road-Runner
A self-interest 2D game built in Unity and scripted in C#, Road Runner is a 2D robotic motions game where a robotic sprite controlled by the user has to run, jump and navigate across a maze of disconnected platforms to reach the final destination. The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding Reference. The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs a robotic character sprite controlled by the user in a two-dimensional space, navigating through several platforms and ramps built in a disconnected fashion to reach the final goal, without falling into the killzone.
